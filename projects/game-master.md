## Game Master

I wanted to create a simple app for organising notes using the method that I had already done in Obsidian. In the end this project got a little messy, and is currently in the prototyping phase. I have utilised a few different technologies to get to the place where it is at today:

## Tech

1. Remix
2. Cloudflare Pages
3. Hono for the backend
4. Monorepo managed with Turborepo
5. React Aria Components
6. Cloudflare Ai to experiment with generative LLM features
