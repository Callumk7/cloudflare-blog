Hey ðŸ‘‹

My name is Callum, and I am a self-taught web developer. I am currently building [Game Master] and [playQ].
## Background
I have experience as a product manager, spending four years at Dext, and then developed my UX skills and worked for a year at an early stage startup Cambrian, drawing up product requirements for their innovative take on video game development. 

During that time, I got the developer bug, and decided I wanted to work full time as a developer. Since then, I have been teaching myself modern web development fundamentals; JavaScript, Typescript, React, Node, CSS and HTML.
