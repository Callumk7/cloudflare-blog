Dear Potential Employer

Thank you for showing interest in my application, and welcome to my portfolio. With my multifaceted background in _product management_, _user experience design_, mechanical engineering, and _web development_, complemented by my passion for learning and continuous growth, I am confident in my ability to contribute positively to your team.

During the last year and a half, I've dedicated my time to learning web development and have developed a proficiency in JavaScript, TypeScript, React, the Remix Framework, Next.js to a lesser extent, and currently experimenting with Hono Framework for lightweight data APIs. The culmination of my effort is evident in two apps I conceptualised and developed. The first app - PlayQ is a full-stack web application for sharing video game playlists with enhanced interactivity, the other being a dynamic content module for a local charity.

My previous role as a Product Manager and UX Designer has given me invaluable experience working in agile environments, understanding the technical nuances from a development perspective, and leading cross-functional teams to deliver projects efficiently. My innate empathy aids in building productive relationships fostering a cooperative work culture.

I strongly believe that the skills I garnered from my former roles, augmented by my recent foray into web development, will provide a unique standpoint combining technical, design, and product management perspectives critical for a Web Development role.

With an unwavering enthusiasm for embracing newer technologies, contributing to open-source documentation, and exposing myself to system-level languages such as Rust and Go on the side, I am certain I will bring a proactive, learning mindset to.. Your Company™.

Given the opportunity, I look forward to leveraging my skills and experiences to support Your Company™ in achieving its operational and strategic goals while fostering my professional growth as a web developer.

Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to the possibility of discussing this exciting opportunity with you.

Sincerely,

**_Callum Kloos_**
