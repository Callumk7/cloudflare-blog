I wanted to create a simple app for organising notes using the method that I had already done in Obsidian. In the end this project got a little messy, and is currently in the prototyping phase. I have utilised a few different technologies to get to the place where it is at today:
## Tech

1. Remix
2. Cloudflare Pages
3. Hono for the backend
4. Monorepo managed with Turborepo
5. React Aria Components

## Version 2

After working on other projects for a bit, I came back to Game Master with a view of updating the architecture and design of the application based on my experience the first time round.
